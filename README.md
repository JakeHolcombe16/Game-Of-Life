The Game of Life is a 2D evolutionary game. One starts out with a 2D grid of dead cells. The mouse is used to select specific cells to be alive. Then the game continues with a series of 
evolution steps where some set of rules is applied to each cell to determine if it stays dead, stays alive, becomes dead, or becomes alive.

Classic Rules:
1. If the cell is alive and has 2 or 3 living
neighbors, then it stays alive.
2. If the cell is dead and has exactly 3
living neighbors, then it comes alive.
3. Otherwise the cell dies
